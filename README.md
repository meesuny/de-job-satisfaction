# de-job-satisfaction
## Fall 2022 Data Engineering Final Project

The purpose of this project is to show how age, gender, race, education level, salary, and number of children affect levels of job satisfaction. To that end, data was gathered from IPUMS, analyzed, and presented in an interactive dashboard that enables the end user to select the factors in which they are interested.  Please refer to the documentation available on this site for additional information.
